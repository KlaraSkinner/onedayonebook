## About

[Room to Read](http://roomtoread.org) is working with small-scale South African publishers to create original stories in African languages. At One Book One Day events, volunteer creatives turn those stories into beautiful books, which are distributed for free online and printed for thousands of children.

One Book One Day is organised by [Room to Read](http://roomtoread.org), sponsored by the [REACH Trust](http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/reach), and draws on the example set by [Book Dash](https://bookdash.org), which has shown the impact that experienced creatives can have on children's literacy.
