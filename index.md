# REACH Project South&nbsp;Africa

Exciting, indigenous-language storybooks available soon!
{:.subheadline}

Storybooks created in indigenous South African languages can be hard to come by in South Africa – the REACH project supports local publishers to begin to change this.

[Room to Read](http://roomtoread.org) has partnered with [Fire and Lion](https://fireandlion.com) and [African Storybook](http://africanstorybook.org) to publish **20 indigenous language storybooks** created by South Africans. All stories target early grade learners in grades R–3. Each book was originally written in **Sepedi, siSwati, Xitsonga, Tshivenda or isiZulu,** and will be available in all of these languages, as well as English. Anyone can freely download the files, share and distribute these books.

Additionally, **from August 2018,** anyone can order printed copies of the books for low prices. Room to Read will collect all orders in August to create one large print-run so that everyone benefits from volume cost efficiency. By providing low prices, we hope that many provinces, organizations, individuals, and bookstores will purchase printed books so that children throughout South Africa can have access to these exciting, indigenous-language books.   

**This website will be updated in mid August 2018 with a book order form, the book files, and prices.**

This project is funded by Results in Education for All Children (REACH) trust fund at the World Bank and the Global Book Alliance, and supported by the Department of Basic Education.
