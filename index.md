## Background

[Room to Read](http://roomtoread.org) is working with small-scale South African publishers to create original stories in African languages. These events will turn those stories into beautiful books, which will be distributed for free online and printed for thousands of children.

The writers have already been working hard on their stories. On book-making day, volunteer designers, illustrators and editors will join the team to turn them into books.

This event is hosted by [Room to Read](http://roomtoread.org), sponsored by the [REACH Trust](http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/reach), and draws on the amazing example set by [Book Dash](https://bookdash.org), which has shown the impact that experienced creatives can have on children's literacy. Book Dash has generously supported the development of these events. To see their books, created by creatives like you, visit [bookdash.org](https://bookdash.org).
