# REACH Project South&nbsp;Africa

Exciting, African-language storybooks available now!
{:.subheadline}

Storybooks created in African languages can be hard to come by in
South Africa – the REACH project supports local publishers to begin to
change this.

[Room to Read](http://roomtoread.org) has partnered with [Fire and Lion](https://fireandlion.com) and [African Storybook](http://africanstorybook.org) to publish **20 African-language storybooks** created by South Africans. All stories target early grade learners in grades R–3. Each book was originally written in **Sepedi, siSwati, Xitsonga, Tshivenda or isiZulu,** and will be available in all of these languages, as well as English. Anyone can freely download the files, share and distribute these books.

Additionally, **from NOW through 31 August 2018,** anyone can order printed copies of the books for low prices. Room to Read will collect all
orders to create one large print-run so that everyone benefits from
volume cost efficiency. By providing low prices, we hope that many
provinces, organizations, individuals, and bookstores will purchase
printed books so that children throughout South Africa can have access
to these exciting, African-language books.
